Single-view 3D mesh reconstruction aims to reconstruct a 3D mesh using a single view of an object. The process faces some challenges, as for a single view of an object, there can be multiple 3D views that can correspond to that viewing angle. Recently, Deep learning methods have made major progress in this field, it can learn to extract crucial features from the images and use these features to predict 3D meshes. A common approach to Single-view mesh reconstruction is to use a two- stage pipeline. First the model predicts the depth map from the image and then uses the depth map to reconstruct the 3D mesh.


we have introduced the framework for the reconstruction of single-view 3D mesh. Here, we have broken down the process into 3 parts, in the first phase generation of a 3D point cloud from a 2D image process is done. In the second Phase creation of a 3D mesh from the 3D point cloud process is done. And in the third and final phase, the optimization of 3D mesh for a better model is done. This limitation underscores the importance of considering multi-view approaches for more comprehensive 3D reconstructions along with the differential rendering in future iterations of the methodology. The findings of our study suggest that reduction of noise and the need for careful computation in order to produce an accurate depth map for the image has to be done perfectly to achieve the desired accuracy level. However, the obtained precision is great enough to make the process of creating a 3D model easier. Using a Deep Learning (DL) model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), for depth map estimation and feature extraction is suggested as a potential direction for future research. Furthermore, there is potential to improve the 3D model creation process with the application of a
